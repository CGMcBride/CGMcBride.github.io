This assignment is to create a responsive portifolio using what we have learned with bootstrap, flex, grid and @media queries. I wanted my portifolio to be responsive even to the device you are looking on it from such as a smart phone or tablet.

My goal for this is to keep updating to a more fun and professional online portifolio to view, as well as to showcase a few of my web development skills.
